The grammary recognized by tieDye programs:

INT == integer
REAL == real number
STR == quoted string

COMMAND:	OPTION
		SEED
		ACTION

OPTION:		size INT [INT [AT INT INT] ]
		colormap STR		
		write STR [fit | sgi]

SEED:		seed edge WEIGHT

		seed disk INT INT INT WEIGHT
		seed random INT WEIGHT		
		seed random real PERCENT WEIGHT	
		seed image IMAGE 			#  this needs some work
		seed image IMAGE scale real [real]	# why not seed WEIGHT?
		seed image IMAGE scale tofit
