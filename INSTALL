Installation Instructions

To facilitate development on different machines, and to isoloate new
development from software that depends on old (working) versions:

	All development using personally developed code should get include files,
	libraries and binaries from $DEVROOT:

		* $DEVROOT/bin
		* $DEVROOT/include
		* $DEVROOT/lib

	All personally developed code should install and include files, libraries
	and binaries in $DEVROOT.  Each project should check in an "install.bat"
	file to copy the files into $DEVROOT.
