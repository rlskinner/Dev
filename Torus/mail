Subject: patterns from attractors
Status: R

Paul,

Talking with you about patterns and textures reminded me of an article
I had set aside several years ago.  I put a copy of the paper in the
mail for you since it seemed like something that you might like.  The
article is about chaotic attractors on a torus.  I've seen my fair share
of attractors, but I found the ones produced by this system to be
bewildering in their variety.

I modified a program you wrote called "smoke" to look at the system,
and a copy of this is included below.  The program may not make a
whole lot of sense without having read some of the article.  Page 359
describes the particular equations used to make the images in the
article.

I feel there should be some way to harness these images, but there
are at least two problems:  1) navigating the parameter space and
2) making continuous-toned images.  If the subject interests you
I'd like to talk with you about it.

- Greg
