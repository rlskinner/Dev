ChaosMorph:
*  command line tuning:
    *  adjust size of lookup table:
	command line takes a floating point scale of (def 2x) size of
	    tiles
	Attractor has size set explicitly, e.g. (128,128)

    *  enable/disable linear interpolation of lookup table

    *  random number seed

    *  Only display cells hit multiple times
	*  command line arg controls how many times cell must be hit to 
	   be displayed.

    *  Early termination:  computation of the attractor ends when any cell 
       is hit X times 

ChaosDance:
*  command line tuning
   *  shape:  circle, dots, connected grid
   *  complexity:  # points in shape
   *  draw # of old shapes
   *  fade old shapes
   *  connect old shapes with polys
*  get better interval information from sum of sines
*  let shape tell main program about its theta/psi range
*  try negative omega ranges, and more eccentric epsilon ranges
*  more shapes
*  vary omega, epsilon, AND a1, a2, b1, b2 arrays (AND r & s?)

BOTH:
*  man page
*  integrate into desktop screen saver panel
