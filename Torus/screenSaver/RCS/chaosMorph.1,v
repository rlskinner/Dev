.SH NAME
chaosMorph \- chaotic attractor screen saver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chaosMorph
[
.B \-n numPoints
]
[
.B \-p stepSize
]
[
.B \-T tileSize
]
[
.B \-t tableSize
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I chaosMorph 
is a screen saver program that diaplays chaotic attractors
of a family of quasiperiodic functions.  The functions are composed of
weighted sine functions, making the attractors periodic in X and Y.
ChaosMorph exploits this periodicity by tiling the screen with copies
of the attractor.
.PP
The shape of the attractor depends on the eccentricity an two other
parameters.  The shape of the attractor is changed constantly by
varying these parameters before drawing each frame.  In addition, each
time the screen saver function engages, the function is change dby
selecting new random weights for the sine functions.  In other words,
ChaosMorph continuously varies the shape of the attractor, and it
changes the attractor family each time it is engaged.
.PP
The following options are recognized:
.PP
.B \-n 
.I numPoints
.RS
sets the number of points plotted to create the attractor (default
10000).  Larger values make a better looking attractor, but take
longer to compute, reducing the smoothness of the animation.
.RE
.PP
.B \-p 
.I stepSize
.RS
sets amount that the attractor shape parameters are changed after
each frame is displayed (default .01).  A smaller number results
in smoother, but slower, attractor changes.  This can be boring
when the parameters move through areas where the attractor is
relatively simple.
.RE
.PP
.B \-T 
.I tileSize
.RS
set the size of the attractor in pixels (default 256).  The screen
is tiled with whole copies of the attractor, so the default value
results in 5x4 copies of the attractor on a 1280x1024 display.  If
the tile size does not exactly divide into the screen size, then
dead space is left on the top and right.  For example, if the 
tile size is 100, there are 80 blank pixels on the right and 24 at
the top of the screen.
.RE
.PP
.B \-t 
.I tableSize
.RS
computation of the attractor requires several sine evaluations as a
function of the X and Y position of each point plotted.  These
evaluations are accelerated by computing a two-dimensional lookup 
table.  This option sets the size of that table, as a multiple of
the tile size, see above (default 2.0).  Greater values result in
marginally better attractor images.  Smaller values begin to
adversely affect the attractor image, with values less than 1.0 
resulting in severe artifacts.  Note:  the memory required for
this table is not insignificant (especially for a screen saver),
since the program remains resident.  Memory is allocated for
2*tileSize*tileSize floating point values, or 0.5 Mbytes.  Also,
this table is recomputed each time the screen saver is activated,
which results in a delay before an image is displayed.  The larger
the table, the longer the delay and the more memory is used.
