.SH DESCRIPTION
.I chaosDance 
is a screen saver that animates deformations of different 
shapes.  The deformation is controlled by the same function used to
create chaotic attractors in 
.B chaosMorph.
.PP
.B \-p 
.I stepSize
.RS
sets amount that the function parameters are changed after
each frame is displayed (default .01).  A smaller number results in
smoother, but slower, deformations.  
.RE
.PP
.B \-s 
.I shape
.RS
the name of a pre-programmed shape to deform (default circle).  The
currently supported shapes are:
.RS
.IP circle 
a circle.
.IP grid
a 5x5 grid.
.RE
.RE
.PP
.B \-c 
.I complexity
.RS
complexity of the shape to be deformed.  Each shape is defined to
be smooth before being deformed, but it may become jagged after
deformation.  The complexity can be used to improve the smoothness,
with a possible performance penalty.  Most shapes scale up their
internal complexity when the number of iterations (see below) is
increased.  The default complexity varies with each shape:
.RS
.IP circle 
(100) the number of points on the circle.
.IP grid 
(1) the number of points from one along one grid side.
.RE
.RE
.PP
.B \-i 
.I iterations
.RS
the number of iterations of the deformation to be performed (default
2).  A single deformation is often not very interesting.  There is
a corresponding drop in performance.
.RE
.PP
.B \-n 
.I oldShapes
.RS
display previous deformations (default 10).
.RE
.PP
.B \-f 
.I fade
.RS
amount to fade previous deformations (default 0.95).  A value of
1.0 does not fade the color of older deformations.  Smaller values
cause the older deformations to fade more quickly.
